# Assignment 3: Embeddings & ML Fairness

This assignment consists of the following:
* [embeddings](../../materials/embeddings/embeddings.ipynb), introducing basic text processing for representing text as vectors. No work, but you'll need this information for the rest of the assignment so read it carefully!
* [Embeddings](Embeddings.ipynb), in which we'll introduce the cosine similarity calculations and perform the analogy test. 
* [Machine Learning Fairness](MLFairness.ipynb), in which you'll explore bias and debiasing in ML


## Submission Instructions

As with Assignment 2, please submit by running the submit script, only with `-a 3` (since this is assignment 3).
```
./assignment/submit.sh -u your-github-username -a 3
```

It is your responsibility to check that your work has made it to your GitHub repository in the `a3-submit` branch.  As always, a small number of points will be deducted in each assignment for submitting in the wrong place.
